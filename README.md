# Easy IDE
 Easy IDE is a simple approach for RAD GUI creation.
 
 It was made at Visual Basic 6 as a friend challenge, but created a functional IDE :)
 I give only the setup files, but i will give the code later, after challenge is over!
 
Was created with addons in mind, so you can create/change/add your own controls.
Check the addons folder ;)

The IDE right now can easily help you ONLY create a gui for python.
The exported source file is a working program, with as many windows you want
all in one source code file. You only add you behavior code and you are ready to go!
